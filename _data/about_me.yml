description: I am an aerospace engineer passionate about space engineering, spacecraft design and computational mechanics. I am currently pursuing a Ph.D. in Aerospace Engineering in the Aerospace Mechanics Research Center at the University of Colorado Boulder. My research focuses on nonlinear system identification of aerospace systems using machine learning techniques from noisy measurements. Other of my passions are trail running and fitness, reading human interaction and psychology books and traveling around the world to learn from other cultures. 


row_one: Alexandre is a doctoral student in Aerospace Engineering at the University of Colorado Boulder. He is originally from Barcelona, Spain and moved to the United States to continue his graduate studies thanks to the Balsells Fellowship he was awarded in 2016. After graduating from the Technical University of Catalonia (UPC) in 2014, obtaining a B.S. degree in Aerospace Engineering, Alex joined the UPC Nanosat Lab team. The NanoSat Lab research group focuses on designing and developing nano-satellites to test state-of-the-art science instruments and remote sensing techniques. Alexandre was the responsible of developing and validating the attitude determination and control system of the 3Cat-2, a six-unit nanosatellite aiming at testing novel GNSS-R concepts. 3Cat-2 nanosatellite was successfully put into orbit in 2016.

row_two: After his experience at NanoSat Lab, Alex moved to the United States to pursue a Master of Science in Aerospace Engineering at the University of Colorado Boulder. His main research areas of interest comprise structural design optimization, computational mechanics, and spaceflight dynamics. During this time, he worked with Profesor K.C. Park on finite element formulations for multi-physics problems. After completing his MSc, he joined the Aerospace Mechanics Research Center (AMReC) to continue his studies towards a Ph.D. He has been doing research on system identification of complex mechanical systems with Dr. Alireza Doostan, merging fields such as nonlinear dynamical systems, machine learning and model reduction.

row_three: Apart from being passionate about space engineering, spacecraft design and computational mechanics, Alex is fervent lover of all kinds of sports and fitness. He was a handball player for 17 years, competing all over Spain. He is keen on trail running, obstacle course racing, and downhill mountain biking. Alex also loves to spend his free time traveling and meeting people with diverse backgrounds, and reading books about psychology, human interactions and finance.
