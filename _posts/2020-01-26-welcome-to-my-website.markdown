First of all, I would like to thank you for visiting my blog!

New year, new ! I have always wanted to start my own blog and discuss news in science and technology as well as topics related to my research but I have not had time until now. I feel motivated to contribute as much as I can with my background as an aerospace engineer and future doctor of engineering.  

# What is this blog about? What are the topics you will cover?
This blog is a means to share and discuss relevant news and explain concepts that I am encoutering while pursuing my Ph.D. in Aerospace Engineering at the University of Colorado Boulder. The topics covered will be varied and based on my passions and hobbies. They will range from science and technology, to travel and culture experiences. 

# So, what made you decide to start this blog?
The main reason I decided to start this blog series is two-fold. First, I wanted to share my knowledge and thoughts with other people about certain topics in the STEM fields and provide content that may be useful for those who want to learn something new. Second, I am conviced that the best way to learn about something is to try to explain it to others.

# What can I expect from this?
I have always been keen on reading news and articles about different topics, specially science and technology, and wanted to share the relevant ones to comment on. Besides, I enjoy writing technical notes and academic articles to explain myself and better understand some complex concepts that require deep thought. I believe this blog might be useful to engage people with similar interests and possibly create appealing discussions.

# How often would you post new entries?
Depending on my schedule, I will try to post entries on a bi-weekly basis.

# How can I contribute to this blog?
I highly encourage readers to participate in the discussions by commenting their thoughts on the discussion section of each post. Besides, to the extent of my knowledge, I will be happy to answer all questions people might have.

I hope this blog will be useful, and I will try to make it as enjoyable and high-quality as possible with my knowledge and motivation.

Welcome to my blog!
