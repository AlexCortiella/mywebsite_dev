            My name is Alexandre Cortiella, a curious aerospace engineer passionate about science and technology. I am native from Barcelona, Spain and moved to the United States to pursue my Ph.D. in Aerospace Engineering at the University of Colorado Boulder.<br><br>
            I do research on identification of nonlinear mechanical systems from noisy measurements using sparse regularization methods, machine learning and artificial neural networks to understand and predict their behavior.<br><br>
            I aspire to become a seasoned expert in the field and make useful contributions to the aerospace sector.
