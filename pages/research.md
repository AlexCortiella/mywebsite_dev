# Identification of the governing equations of nonlinear physical systems from noisy observations

My current research focuses on nonlinear system identification, where the goal is to identify, understand and predict the behavior of a physical system by constructing an approximate model from noisy measurements.

Engineering relies heavily on mathematical models of real systems. In the design process, engineers seek the best models that describe the physical system they want to design and optimize. However, physical processes are often highly complex and not entirely understood, so the modeling of the first principles can be challenging, sometimes even impossible. System identification allows for any system, however complex or obscure, to be modeled solely on the basis of measurements.
